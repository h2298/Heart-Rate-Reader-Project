# Heart-Rate-Reader-Project
To run this program, you need to have OpenCv and fftw installed and configured.
In the main.cpp file, change the path on line 8 that is being passed into the readHeartRate function to be the exact path to the movie file that will be read in.
In HeartRateReader.cpp, on line 25, change the path to the exact path of the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file on your computer (should be part of the OpenCv installation).

The BPM that I measured from the video is 68.1668 BPM.
